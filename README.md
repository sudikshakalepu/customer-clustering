Performed a clustering analysis on nightclub customers based on their perceptions of pricing fairness, intent to revisit, and demographic variables. The goal is to identify distinct customer segments that can provide insights into their behavior and preferences.

##### Data Preprocessing:
Clean and prepare the data by handling missing values and normalizing the fairness rating and revisit intent variables.
Encode categorical variables like CustomerType, Pricing_Strategy, and Ethnicity appropriately.
##### Clustering:
Experiment with different types of clustering and different number of clusters to form clusters of customers to inform nightclub management. At minimum, you should try two different clustering methods. 
##### Interpretation:
Analyze the characteristics of each customer segment. What are the key traits that differentiate these clusters?
How do the clusters differ in terms of their perceptions of fairness and intent to revisit the nightclub?
##### Insights:
Based on the identified clusters, provide recommendations to the nightclub management. Should they tailor their pricing strategies to different customer segments? How can they improve customer satisfaction?
